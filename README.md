# Upnotes

Music Player

Using the Jamendo API, Upnotes is a web application which lets you browse and play music from independent artists. The app provides the user with a range of options to find the music. Click through to top lists of artists, tracks and albums, filter it all based on music genre and popularity over a desired time span, or perform a custom search based on keywords. Play songs and add more to the queue to keep listening.
